# Gamer Lists

## Description

"Gamer Lists" https://glowing-adventure.onrender.com is a social media website, where gamers can post their lists of games. <br>
All posts can also be commented by other users to start a discussion about videogames. <br>
All three members of our team love playing videogames, so we decided to create this gamer space, <br>
where we are free to share our thoughts on any videogames we have or haven't played. <br>
We learned that by using a MERN tech stack, we are equipped with the skills to create apps <br>
with an architecture capable of upscaling and downscaling without compromising code integrity.
